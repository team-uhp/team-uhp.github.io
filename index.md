## Overview

TeamUHP! is a platform for students to connect across areas of study by enabling them to upload project postings and recruit collaborators. Whether it’s a class assignment or a passion project, students can find teammates with complementary skills and allow each contributor to play a meaningful role that aligns with their field of study. This medium of collaboration helps students to gain practical experience, build teamwork skills, and add completed projects to their resumes.

## Development History
The development process for TeamUHp conforms to Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) practices. In this model: 
- Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
- Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
- Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
- Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
- The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named “issue-XX”, where XX is replaced by the issue number.
- When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
- The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.
- The following sections document the development history of BowFolios.
